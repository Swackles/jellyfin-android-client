# Unnamed Jellyfin Android Client

This is a WIP Jellyfin client for Android, written in Kotlin.

## Motivation

Motiviation for creating this project was to reimagine the Jellyfin Android client from the ground up. The current android clients, both the official and Findroid are great, but personally not a fan of their UI. So I wanted to create something that more resembles modern Android apps. Now, I am not a professional UI designer, nor am I a professional Android developer, so I use this project to learn both.
